# Delhi Air Quality Analysis (SQL + Power BI)

This project explores air pollution trends in Delhi using SQL and Power BI. The dataset includes daily concentrations of pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, CO, SO₂, and Ozone, along with AQI values, weekday info, and holiday counts.

## Dataset
Source: Delhi Air Quality Dataset from Kaggle  
Features: Date, Pollutants, AQI, AQI Category, Holiday Count, Day of Week

## Goals
- Analyze trends in AQI and pollutants over time
- Explore weekday vs. weekend pollution patterns
- Assess holiday effects on air quality
- Identify most problematic pollutants and severe events

## Tools
- SQL (for data exploration)
- Power BI (dashboard and visuals)


## Next Steps
- Create SQL queries for trends and pollutant analysis
- Build Power BI dashboard from cleaned data
